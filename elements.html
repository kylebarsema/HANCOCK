						<br>HS has been awarded a $3,250 grant from the 2018 Lowe's Toolbox for Education grant from the Lowe's Charitable and Educational Foundation (LCEF). Mrs. Heather Spengler, HHS English teacher and Student Council advisor, submitted the request for the grant under the following project name, Save the Volleyball Courts from Becoming Ancient Ruins. She received notification Thursday that the school had been awarded the grant. The funds, to be awarded in the coming weeks, cover the cost of materials and equipment to be used to redo the volleyball courts between C building and the athletic fields on the HHS campus.
